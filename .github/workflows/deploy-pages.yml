# Deploy Flutter web to GitHub Pages using the OFFICIAL GitHub Actions deployment.
# Your app (not README) is shown because we deploy ONLY build/web — no branch, no repo root.
#
# SETUP (one time): Repo Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: choose "GitHub Actions".
# Then push to main/master or run this workflow. Your app: https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/
