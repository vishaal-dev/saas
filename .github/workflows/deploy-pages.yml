# Deploy Flutter web to GitHub Pages so the app (not README) is shown.
#
# How it works:
# - web/index.html is a template (keeps <base href="$FLUTTER_BASE_HREF">). Never change it.
# - flutter build web --base-href /repo/ replaces $FLUTTER_BASE_HREF only in build/web/index.html.
# - We push ONLY the contents of build/web to the gh-pages branch. GitHub Pages must serve that branch.
#
# IMPORTANT: In repo Settings → Pages → Source choose "Deploy from a branch" → Branch: gh-pages → Save.
# First time: you may need to select the gh-pages branch in Settings → Pages first, then run this workflow.
