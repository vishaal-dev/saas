# Build Flutter web and deploy to gh-pages so GitHub Pages serves your app (not README).
#
# How Flutter web deploy works:
# - web/index.html is a template (keeps <base href="$FLUTTER_BASE_HREF">). Never change it for deploy.
# - flutter build web --base-href /repo/ replaces $FLUTTER_BASE_HREF only in build/web/index.html.
# - We must upload ONLY the contents of build/web (the generated files), NOT the project root, NOT web/, NOT lib/.
#
# After this runs: Settings → Pages → Source: "Deploy from a branch" → branch: gh-pages → Save.
